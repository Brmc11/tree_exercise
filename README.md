# Binary Trees

The exercise this week is to implement a binary tree
and depth first search. I've created the test for you
with simple constructor that takes a list of numbers. 
You'll need to:

- Fork this repo (if you need help, ask). This will help 
me easily see everyone's code
- Implement a constructor that builds the tree given 
a list of numbers
- Implement `depthFirstSearch`
