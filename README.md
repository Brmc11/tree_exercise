# Binary Trees

This, week, we'll be looking at trees.

Here are the readings:

* [How To Not Be Stumped By Trees](https://medium.com/basecs/how-to-not-be-stumped-by-trees-5f36208f68a7)
* [Leaf It Up To Binary Trees](https://medium.com/basecs/leaf-it-up-to-binary-trees-11001aaf746d)
* [Demystifying Depth-First Search](https://medium.com/basecs/demystifying-depth-first-search-a7c14cccf056)
* [Breaking Down Breadth-First Search](https://medium.com/basecs/breaking-down-breadth-first-search-cebe696709d9)

The coding exercise this week is to implement a binary tree, depth first search, and in order traversal. 
You'll need to:

- Fork this repo (if you need help, ask). This will help 
me easily see everyone's code
- Implement `insert` to add a number the binary tree
in the correct position
- Implement `depthFirstSearch`
- Implement `inOrderTraversal`
- For extra credit, implement `BinaryTree` as a
generic, e. g. `BinaryTree<Int> or BinaryTree<String>`

While it is true that none of the test actually force 
you to create a real BinaryTree, please do :)
